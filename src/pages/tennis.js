          <h5>HOW TO PLAY TENNIS?</h5>
          <p>
            Tennis is played by hitting the ball back and forth over the net. The game begins with a serve, and players must return the ball before it bounces twice on their side. Points are won when the ball is hit into the opponent’s court and they are unable to return it properly.

          <p>
            Points are won by successfully hitting the ball into the opponent’s court in a way they cannot return. Tennis scoring involves points (15, 30, 40), games, sets, and matches. A match is typically won by the first player to win six games, with at least a two-game lead.
