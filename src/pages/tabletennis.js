          <p>
            Points are scored when the opponent fails to return the ball, hits the ball out of bounds, or allows the ball to bounce more than once on their side. A match is typically played to 11 points, with the winner needing to lead by at least 2 points. Games are often played in best-of-five or best-of-seven formats.

            Players use a variety of techniques such as topspin, backspin, and side spin to control the ball's trajectory and speed. Mastery of the serve is crucial for gaining an advantage, and footwork plays a key role in quickly positioning oneself to return the ball effectively.
