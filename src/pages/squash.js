            Squash is an indoor sport played by two players (singles) or four players (doubles) who take turns hitting a small rubber ball against a front wall using rackets. The objective is to make the ball bounce twice on the opponent’s side before they can return it.

          <p>
            A squash court is an enclosed, rectangular area with walls on all four sides. The floor is typically 9.75 meters in length and 6.4 meters in width for singles play. There are specific markings on the walls and floor that help determine where the ball should be hit.

          <h5>HOW TO PLAY SQUASH?</h5>
          <p>
            In squash, players take turns hitting the ball against the front wall. The ball must be hit below the outline of the front wall and within the boundaries on the side walls. Points are won when an opponent fails to return the ball before it bounces twice.

          <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>
            Points in squash are typically played using either traditional hand-in-hand-out scoring or the more modern rally scoring. In rally scoring, points can be scored regardless of who serves. Games are usually played to 11 or 15 points, and matches are typically played in a best-of-three or best-of-five format.
