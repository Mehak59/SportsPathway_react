        <h5>WHAT IS TENNIS?</h5>
                <p>Tennis or lawn tennis is often regarded as one of the most physically demanding sports around.
                    Tennis has thrown up various global stars in different eras - from Rod Laver and Martina Navratilova to 
                    Pete Sampras, Steffi Graf, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.
                    The four marquee tennis tournaments every year, the Grand Slams - Australian Open, French Open, 
                    Wimbledon and the US Open - provide high-quality action throughout the year in addition to various
                    lower-level tournaments to keep fans engaged.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
                <p><b>Tennis ball: </b>According to the International Tennis Federation (ITF),
                     a typical tennis ball should weigh between 56-59.4 grams with a diameter
                    of 6.54-6.86 centimeters. They should be yellow or white in colour, though
                    most balls are yellow.<br>
                    <b>Tennis racket:</b> A tennis racket cannot exceed 73.7 cm in length and 31.7 cm in width.
                    The racket shall have a frame enclosing sturdy strings, usually made of nylon, interwoven
                    in crossed and bonded pattern, and a handle.<br>
                    The player is required to hit the ball with the middle of the racket - the part with 
                    strings which is also known as hitting surface.</p>

        <h5>TENNIS COURT</h5>
              <p>A tennis court is a rectangular playing surface used for the sport
                of tennis. It is divided by a net into two equal halves and features
                specific markings for singles and doubles play. The court can be made 
                of various materials, such as grass, clay, hard surfaces, or artificial
                turf, each influencing the speed and style of play. Standard dimensions 
                are 78 feet (23.77 meters) long and 27 feet (8.23 meters) wide for singles,
                and 36 feet (10.97 meters) wide for doubles. The surface and surroundings 
                are designed to provide a consistent and fair playing environment for players.</p>

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY TENNIS?</h5>
          <p>In tennis, the match begins with a coin toss to decide who serves, receives, or picks
             a side. The server stands behind the baseline and must hit the ball diagonally into the 
             opponent's service area. Each player gets two serves per point. A fault occurs if the serve
             hits the net or lands outside the service area, giving the server a second attempt. A foot
             fault, where the server's foot touches the baseline or sideline, also results in a second
             serve. A double fault (faulting both serves) gives the point to the opponent. If the serve
             hits the net but lands in the correct area, it's a "let," and the server gets another chance. 
             An ace, where the serve is not returned, wins the point for the server.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
          <p>In tennis, each point starts with a serve, and the receiver's goal is to return 
            the ball. Players then engage in a rally, hitting the ball back and forth. A point is won if 
            the ball is hit before it bounces twice or if the opponent fails to return it. Players must wait
             for the ball to cross the net and cannot step over it. After a game, server and receiver roles 
             switch, and in doubles, the receiving team alternates players for each point.</p>

      <div class="content-text">
        <h5>SCORING SYSTEM</h5>
          <p>A player or team has to win four points to win a game. Any game starts at 0-0 and the zero
             point in tennis is called love. The progression of points occurs as 1st(15),2nd(30),3rd(40) and 4th(Game)
            However, if both players win three points each in a game (i.e score is 40-40), then it's 
            called a deuce.
             After deuce, the player who wins the next point has advantage. If the player/team who 
            has advantage wins the next point, then they win the game.
            However, if the opposing player wins the next point after advantage, then the score moves
             back to deuce. A player/team needs to win two consecutive points after deuce to win a game.
