            Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport known for its agility, speed,
          and strategic play. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a
          net, aiming to score points by landing it in the opponent's court. The
          sport's quick reflexes, precise control, and tactical depth create an
          exciting and dynamic experience for both players and spectators.

        <h5>WHAT IS BADMINTON?</h5>
        <p>
          Badminton is one of the most popular sports in the world, with a
            passionate fan following around the globe. It is also one of the
            biggest draws at multi-sport spectacles like the Olympics. A regular
            fixture since the Barcelona 1992 Olympics, badminton now has five
            disciplines at the Games after mixed doubles was introduced at
            Atlanta 1996. While badminton is most popular in Asia, it also
            attracts great interest in Europe with players from Denmark among
            those regularly challenging for top honours.

        <h5>EQUIPMENT USED</h5>
        <p>
          <b>Racket: </b>A lightweight racket made of materials like carbon
          fiber or aluminum, designed for speed and control.<br />
          <b>Shuttlecock: </b>It has a rounded cork base, which is often
          covered with thin leather, and is topped with a skirt made of 16
          overlapping feathers. The unique design allows it to be
          aerodynamically stable, ensuring it flies smoothly through the air
          while rapidly decelerating. Shuttlecocks are lightweight, usually
          weighing between 4.74 to 5.50 grams.

        <h5>BADMINTON COURT</h5>
        <p>
          Badminton Courts are the rectangular surfaces used for the racket
          sport of badminton. Courts are usually marked for both singles or
          doubles games with boundary widths varying between the two match
          types. Badminton courts are surfaced with safe flooring materials
          for gameplay. Badminton Courts have a length of 44’ (13.4 m), but
          double courts are 20’ (6.1 m) wide while single courts are reduced
          to 17’ (5.18 m); shrinking by 1.5’ (.46 m) on both sides. Service
          courts are split by a center line dividing the width of the court
          and are set back from the net by a ‘short service line’ of 6.5’.
          Doubles games also require a ‘long service line. Clearances of 2’
          (.61 m) should be providing around the entire badminton court.

        <h5>HOW TO PLAY BADMINTON?</h5>
        <p>
          In badminton, players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net,
            aiming to land it in the opponent’s court. The game starts with a
            serve, and players take turns hitting the shuttlecock, trying to
            score points by making it bounce within the opponent’s court
            boundaries. Points are won if the shuttlecock lands in the court, if
            the opponent fails to return it, or if they commit a fault. The game
            requires quick reflexes, precise shots, and strategic play to
            outmaneuver the opponent.

        <h5>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h5>
        <p>
          The birdie must be hit below waist height, with players serving
            diagonally into their opponent’s service box. Both players must
            remain stationary until the serve is made. As per badminton singles
            rules, the server starts from the right service court, and will
            serve from that side every time they have an even amount of points.
            A player serves from the left every time they have an odd amount of
            points. Each player will retain serve for as long as they keep
            winning points. If the receiving side takes the point, they assume
            serve. Going forward, the player who did not initially serve for
            each team will only assume the service once their side has won a
            point as the receiving side.
