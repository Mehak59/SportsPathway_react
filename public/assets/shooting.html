          Shooting is a precision sport that requires a combination of skill,
          focus, and patience. It involves using a firearm to aim and fire at a
          target, often with the goal of hitting it as accurately as possible.
          Whether it's for recreational purposes, competitive events, or
          hunting, shooting demands a deep understanding of firearms, safety
          protocols, and the ability to control one's breath and steady one's
          aim.

          <p>
            <b>Firearm:</b> The primary tool used to shoot, such as a rifle,
            shotgun, or pistol. <br />
            <b>Ammunition:</b> The projectiles fired from the firearm, including
            bullets, shot, or slugs. Target: The object aimed at, often made of
            paper, metal, or clay. <br />

          <h3>SHOOTING RANGE</h3>
          <p>
            A shooting range is a designated area where individuals can practice
            shooting firearms in a controlled and safe environment. It typically
            features target stands, a backstop to contain bullets, and safety
            regulations to prevent accidents. Shooting ranges can be indoor or
            outdoor, and they may offer a variety of shooting disciplines, such
            as pistol, rifle, or shotgun.

          <h3>PROCEDURE FOR SHOOTING</h3>
          <p>
            The match in shooting typically begins with a safety briefing.
            Participants gather to review the rules and procedures for the
            specific shooting event, ensuring everyone understands the safety
            guidelines and competition requirements. After the safety briefing,
            the shooting order is determined. This can be done through a draw, a
            predetermined ranking system, or another method specific to the
            event. Once the shooting order is established, the competition
            begins. Shooters take turns aiming and firing at their targets,
            following the specific rules and guidelines for the event. The
            scoring is recorded for each shot, and the shooter with the highest
            total score at the end of the competition wins.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In shooting, points are typically scored based on the accuracy of
            the shots. The target is often divided into concentric circles, with
            the center circle being worth the most points. The closer a shot is
            to the center of the target, the more points it is awarded. The
            specific scoring system can vary depending on the competition or
            league. However, the general principle remains the same: accuracy is
            rewarded with points. Additionally, some competitions may have bonus
            points for hitting specific targets or achieving a certain level of
            consistency.

          <h3>SCORING SYSTEM</h3>
          <p>
            Points per hit: Each successful hit on the target is awarded a
            certain number of points. The shooter with the highest total points
            at the end of the competition wins. <br />
            Knockdown scoring: In some events, targets are designed to fall when
            hit. Each knockdown is awarded a certain number of points. <br />
            Time-based scoring: In certain events, time may be a factor.
            Shooters may have a limited amount of time to complete their shots,
            and points may be deducted for exceeding the time limit. <br />
            Bonus points: Some events may offer bonus points for hitting
            specific parts of the target or for achieving certain levels of
            accuracy.
