          and a small ball. It involves two teams of eleven players each, aiming

          is known for its fast-paced action, strategic play, and physical

          <h3>WHAT IS HOCKEY?</h3>
          <p>
            Hockey is a dynamic team sport played on ice or a field, where two
            teams of skaters or players use a stick to maneuver a small ball or
            puck into the opposing team's goal. In ice hockey, played on a rink,
            players wear skates and protective gear, and the game involves
            high-speed skating, strategic passes, and physical checks. Field
            hockey is played on grass or artificial turf with a hard ball and
            requires skillful dribbling, passing, and shooting. Both versions of
            the game aim to score more goals than the opponent, with matches
            typically divided into two halves or three periods. Hockey demands
            agility, teamwork, and tactical awareness.

          <h3>HOCKEY FIELD</h3>
          <p>
            A hockey field is a rectangular playing area used for field hockey.
            It is typically made of grass or artificial turf. The field is
            divided into two halves by a center line, and there is a goal at
            each end of the field. The exact dimensions of a hockey field can
            vary, but the standard size is 91.4 meters (100 yards) long and 55
            meters (60 yards) wide. The goal is 3 meters (10 feet) wide and 2.13
            meters (7 feet) high.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY HOCKEY?</h3>
          <p>
            Hockey is a team sport played on a field with a hockey stick and a
            small ball. The objective is to score goals by hitting the ball into
            the opponent's net. The game involves two teams of eleven players
            each, and it is played in two halves with a short break between
            them. The game starts with a face-off, and players use their hockey
            sticks to move the ball towards the opponent's goal. Fouls can
            result in penalties, and the team that scores the most goals by the
            end of the game wins.

          <h3>HOW ARE GOALS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In field hockey, goals are scored by hitting the ball into the
            opponent's net. The ball must cross the goal line completely and not
            be deflected by a defender or the goalkeeper. Defenders try to
            prevent the attacking team from reaching the goal, while attackers
            attempt to dribble the ball towards the net and create scoring
            opportunities. The goalkeeper serves as the last line of defense,
            trying to stop the ball from entering the net. Overall, scoring in
            field hockey requires a combination of skill, teamwork, and
            strategy.

          <h3>SCORING SYSTEM</h3>
          <p>
            In hockey, goals are the primary way to score points. Each goal
            scored is typically awarded one point. The team with the most goals
            at the end of the game is the winner. <br />However, some hockey
            leagues or tournaments may have additional scoring systems, such as:
            <br />
            <b>Bonus points:</b> Some leagues may award bonus points for certain
            achievements, such as shutting out the opponent or winning by a
            large margin. <br /><b>Overtime points:</b> In some leagues,
            overtime periods may be played to determine the winner if the game
            is tied after regulation time. The team that scores the first goal
            in overtime may be awarded additional points.
