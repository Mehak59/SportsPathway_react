          Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport known for its agility, speed,
          and strategic play. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a
          net, aiming to score points by landing it in the opponent's court. The
          sport's quick reflexes, precise control, and tactical depth create an
          exciting and dynamic experience for both players and spectators.

            Atlanta 1996. While badminton is most popular in Asia, it also
            attracts great interest in Europe with players from Denmark among
            those regularly challenging for top honours. Want to learn more

          <h3>EQUIPMENT USED</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Racket: </b>A lightweight racket made of materials like carbon
            fiber or aluminum, designed for speed and control.<br />
            <b>Shuttlecock:</b>It has a rounded cork base, which is often
            covered with thin leather, and is topped with a skirt made of 16
            overlapping feathers. The unique design allows it to be
            aerodynamically stable, ensuring it flies smoothly through the air
            while rapidly decelerating. Shuttlecocks are lightweight, usually
            weighing between 4.74 to 5.50 grams.

          <h3>BADMINTON COURT</h3>
          <p>
            Badminton Courts are the rectangular surfaces used for the racket
            sport of badminton. Courts are usually marked for both singles or
            doubles games with boundary widths varying between the two match
            types. Badminton courts are surfaced with safe flooring materials
            for gameplay. Badminton Courts have a length of 44’ (13.4 m), but
            double courts are 20’ (6.1 m) wide while single courts are reduced
            to 17’ (5.18 m); shrinking by 1.5’ (.46 m) on both sides. Service
            courts are split by a center line dividing the width of the court
            and are set back from the net by a ‘short service line’ of 6.5’.
            Doubles games also require a ‘long service line. Clearances of 2’
            (.61 m) should be providing around the entire badminton court.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY BADMINTON?</h3>
          <p>
            In badminton, players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock over a net,
            aiming to land it in the opponent’s court. The game starts with a
            serve, and players take turns hitting the shuttlecock, trying to
            score points by making it bounce within the opponent’s court
            boundaries. Points are won if the shuttlecock lands in the court, if
            the opponent fails to return it, or if they commit a fault. The game
            requires quick reflexes, precise shots, and strategic play to
            outmaneuver the opponent.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            Points in badminton are scored using the rally scoring system, where
            a point is awarded on every serve, regardless of which player
            served. A player earns a point by landing the shuttlecock in the
            opponent's court, if the opponent fails to return it, or if they
            commit a fault. Matches are typically played to 21 points, with the
            winner needing at least a 2-point lead. If the score reaches 20-20,
            the game continues until one player gains a 2-point advantage.

          <h3>SERVE IN BADMINTON</h3>
          <p>
            The birdie must be hit below waist height, with players serving
            diagonally into their opponent’s service box. Both players must
            remain stationary until the serve is made. As per badminton singles
            rules, the server starts from the right service court, and will
            serve from that side every time they have an even amount of points.
            A player serves from the left every time they have an odd amount of
            points. Each player will retain serve for as long as they keep
            winning points. If the receiving side takes the point, they assume
            serve. Going forward, the player who did not initially serve for
            each team will only assume the service once their side has won a
            point as the receiving side.
