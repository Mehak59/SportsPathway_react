          <h3>TENNIS COURT</h3>
          <p>
            A tennis court is a rectangular playing surface used for the sport
            of tennis. It is divided by a net into two equal halves and features
            specific markings for singles and doubles play. The court can be
            made of various materials, such as grass, clay, hard surfaces, or
            artificial turf, each influencing the speed and style of play.
            Standard dimensions are 78 feet (23.77 meters) long and 27 feet
            (8.23 meters) wide for singles, and 36 feet (10.97 meters) wide for
            doubles. The surface and surroundings are designed to provide a
            consistent and fair playing environment for players.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY TENNIS?</h3>
          <p>
            In tennis, the match begins with a coin toss to decide who serves,
            receives, or picks a side. The server stands behind the baseline and
            must hit the ball diagonally into the opponent's service area. Each
            player gets two serves per point. A fault occurs if the serve hits
            the net or lands outside the service area, giving the server a
            second attempt. A foot fault, where the server's foot touches the
            baseline or sideline, also results in a second serve. A double fault
            (faulting both serves) gives the point to the opponent. If the serve
            hits the net but lands in the correct area, it's a "let," and the
            server gets another chance. An ace, where the serve is not returned,
            wins the point for the server.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In tennis, each point starts with a serve, and the receiver's goal
            is to return the ball. Players then engage in a rally, hitting the
            ball back and forth. A point is won if the ball is hit before it
            bounces twice or if the opponent fails to return it. Players must
            wait for the ball to cross the net and cannot step over it. After a
            game, server and receiver roles switch, and in doubles, the
            receiving team alternates players for each point.

          <h3>SCORING SYSTEM</h3>
          <p>
            A player or team has to win four points to win a game. Any game
            starts at 0-0 and the zero point in tennis is called love. The
            progression of points occurs as 1st(15),2nd(30),3rd(40) and
            4th(Game) However, if both players win three points each in a game
            (i.e score is 40-40), then it's called a deuce. After deuce, the
            player who wins the next point has advantage. If the player/team who
            has advantage wins the next point, then they win the game. However,
            if the opposing player wins the next point after advantage, then the
            score moves back to deuce. A player/team needs to win two
            consecutive points after deuce to win a game.
