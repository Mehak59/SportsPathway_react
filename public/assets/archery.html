          <h3>WHAT IS Archery?</h3>
          <p>
            Archery is a sport where players use a bow to shoot arrows at a
            target. The objective is to score points by hitting the target's
            central area, known as the "bullseye." Archery requires precision,
            control, and focus, with participants aiming from varying distances
            depending on the event. It includes different forms such as target
            archery, field archery, and bowhunting. Historically significant and
            practiced in various cultures, archery is also a popular competitive
            sport, featured in the Olympics and numerous international
            tournaments.

          <h3>ARCHERY GROUND</h3>
          <p>
            An archery ground is a designated area for practicing and competing
            in archery. It typically features a target range with targets set at
            various distances, shooting lanes for archers, and safety zones to
            protect spectators and non-participants. A scoreboard is often
            present to display scores and distances. These grounds are designed
            to provide a safe and organized environment for archers to practice
            and compete.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY ARCHERY?</h3>
          <p>
            To play archery, set up your bow, arrows, and target. Stand with
            your feet shoulder-width apart and nock an arrow onto the bowstring.
            Draw the bowstring back, aim at the target, and release the string
            smoothly to shoot the arrow. After shooting, check the target to see
            where your arrow landed and score based on its proximity to the
            center. Practicing these steps helps develop precision and control
            in archery.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In archery, points are scored based on where the arrow lands on the
            target. The target is divided into concentric rings, with the
            innermost ring, or bullseye, scoring the highest points. Each ring
            outside the bullseye is worth progressively fewer points. When an
            arrow lands within a specific ring, the score for that ring is
            awarded. If an arrow lands on the line between two rings, the higher
            score is given. Accurate aiming and consistent shooting are key to
            maximizing points.

          <h3>TARGET IN ARCHERY</h3>
          <p>
            In archery, the target is a circular board with concentric rings,
            each representing different point values. The center ring, or
            bullseye, scores the highest points, while the outer rings decrease
            in value as they move outward. The target is usually placed at a set
            distance from the archer and can be made from materials like straw,
            foam, or other specialized substances. Accurate shots into the
            bullseye or inner rings yield higher scores, making the target a
            crucial element for scoring and competition in archery.
