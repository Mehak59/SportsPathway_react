        <p>
          Squash is a fast-paced racquet sport played either one-on-one
          (singles) or with two teams of two players each (doubles). It’s played
          on a four-walled court, and the objective is to hit a small rubber
          ball against the front wall in such a way that the opponent cannot
          return it before it bounces twice.

          <h3>EQUIPMENT USED</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Racket: </b>Squash racquets are lightweight, typically weighing
            between 110 to 160 grams, and have a small, oval-shaped head. They
            are designed to provide control and power while being easy to
            maneuver.<br />
            <b>Ball:</b>The squash ball is small, rubber, and comes in various
            types that differ in bounce and speed. The most common balls are
            color-coded (e.g., yellow for extra-duty, red for standard) to
            indicate their level of bounce and suitability for different court
            surfaces.

          <h3>SQUASH COURT</h3>
          <p>
            A squash court is a four-walled space, measuring 9.75 meters long
            and 6.4 meters wide. It features a front wall with an "outline" at
            the top and a "tin" at the bottom. The side and back walls are also
            in play. The court includes service boxes where the server stands,
            and various lines that define play areas. Courts are often
            constructed from wood or glass, with glass walls popular in
            professional settings for viewing purposes. The floor is marked with
            a short line that divides the court into two halves. The front
            wall's upper boundary ensures the ball stays within the play area.
            The walls are typically painted white or have a reflective surface
            to improve visibility. The court's dimensions and markings are
            standardized to ensure consistent play across different locations.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY SQUASH?</h3>
          <p>
            To play squash, hit the ball against the front wall so your opponent
            can’t return it before it bounces twice. Serve from one of the
            service boxes, making sure the ball hits above the service line and
            lands in the opposite box. During rallies, the ball must hit the
            front wall before bouncing on the floor. Points are scored when your
            opponent fails to return the ball or hits it out of bounds. The game
            requires quick reflexes and strategic positioning.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In squash, points are scored based on several key factors. You earn
            a point if your opponent fails to return the ball before it bounces
            twice on the floor. The ball must be hit before it bounces twice, so
            if your opponent misses or lets it bounce twice, you win the point.
            Additionally, points are awarded if the opponent's shot goes out of
            bounds; the ball must strike the front wall between the top boundary
            (outline) and the bottom boundary (tin). If the ball hits above the
            outline or below the tin, it’s out of play, and you score a point.

          <h3>HOW TO WIN IN SQUASH?</h3>
          <p>
            To win in squash, score more points than your opponent by
            successfully hitting the ball against the front wall so they cannot
            return it before it bounces twice. Points are earned when your
            opponent fails to make a valid return, hits the ball out of bounds,
            or obstructs your play. Matches are typically played to 11 or 9
            points, and the player who first reaches the required number of
            points wins the game. Matches are often played as the best of three
            or five games.
