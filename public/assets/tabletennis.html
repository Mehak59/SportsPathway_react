          <h3>WHAT IS TABLE TENNIS?</h3>
          <p>
            Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a fast-paced indoor sport
            played on a rectangular table divided by a net. The objective is for
            players to hit a lightweight ball back and forth across the table
            using small paddles, aiming to make the ball land on the opponent's
            side in such a way that they cannot return it.

          <h3>EQUIPMENT USED</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Table:</b> The primary playing surface, a rectangular table
            divided into two halves by a net. It is typically made of wood or a
            similar sturdy material. <br />
            <b>Ball:</b> A small, lightweight ball made of celluloid. It is
            slightly larger than a ping pong ball and has a slightly softer
            bounce. <br /><b>Paddles:</b> Flat, wooden or composite paddles with
            a rubber surface. The rubber surface provides grip and control when
            hitting the ball. <br />
            <b>Net:</b>A fine mesh net stretched across the middle of the table,
            dividing the playing area into two halves. <br /><b>Racket case:</b>
            A case used to store and transport paddles and balls. It helps
            protect the equipment from damage.

          <h3>TABLE TENNIS COURT</h3>
          <p>
            The playing surface in table tennis is called a table. It is
            rectangular in shape, divided into two halves by a net. The
            dimensions of a standard table tennis table are 274 cm (108 in)
            long, 152.5 cm (60 in) wide, and 76 cm (30 in) high. The net is
            15.25 cm (6 in) high at the edges and 18.19 cm (7.16 in) high in the
            center.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY TABLE TENNIS?</h3>
          <p>
            Table tennis matches typically begin with a coin toss to determine
            who serves first. The player who wins the toss can choose to serve
            or receive. Once the server is determined, the match begins with a
            serve, where the server tosses the ball upward and hits it over the
            net. The opponent must return the ball back over the net before it
            bounces a second time on their side. The game continues with players
            alternating serves after each point, and the first player to reach
            the predetermined number of points wins the game. The match is
            typically played to a set number of games, with the player who wins
            the most games emerging victorious.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            Points in table tennis are scored based on the outcome of each
            rally. A rally is a series of strokes between the players until the
            ball is no longer playable. Points are awarded to the player who
            successfully returns the ball to the opponent's side, or if the
            opponent fails to return the ball, hits the ball out of bounds, or
            touches the net during play (except for the serve). The first player
            to reach the predetermined number of points wins the game, typically
            11 points with a 2-point advantage required.

            win. If the score reaches 10-10, the game continues until one player
            has a 2-point lead. The first player to win the best-of-seven games
            wins the match.
