          Golf is a precision sport where players use a variety of clubs to hit
          a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as
          possible. The game is played on a vast, landscaped course with
          different types of terrain, including fairways, greens, and hazards.

          <h3>WHAT IS GOLF?</h3>
          <p>
            Golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball
            with various clubs from a series of starting points (teeing grounds)
            into a series of holes on a course. The player who holes his ball in
            the fewest strokes wins. The origins of the game are difficult to
            ascertain, although evidence now suggests that early forms of golf
            were played in the Netherlands first and then in Scotland.

          <p>
            A golf ground, or golf course, is a landscaped area designed for the
            sport of golf. It typically features 18 holes, each with a tee box,
            fairway, green, and various hazards such as bunkers and water
            hazards. The layout is carefully designed to challenge players with
            different terrains and obstacles. The course includes walking paths
            or cart paths for players to move between holes. Overall, the golf
            ground provides a setting for players to test their skills and enjoy
            the game in a natural, often picturesque environment.

          <h3>HOW TO PLAY GOLF?</h3>
          <p>
            To play golf, you aim to hit a ball into a series of holes on a
            course using the fewest number of strokes. Start by teeing off from
            the designated area and use a driver or iron to strike the ball down
            the fairway toward the green. Once on the green, use a putter to
            roll the ball into the hole. Each hole has a par, which is the
            number of strokes an expert is expected to take to complete it.
            Success in golf requires skill, precision, and strategic planning to
            navigate the course and overcome obstacles.

          <h3>HOW ARE POINTS SCORED?</h3>
          <p>
            In golf, points are scored based on the number of strokes taken to
            complete each hole. Each hole has a par value, representing the
            number of strokes an expert golfer is expected to use. Scoring is
            straightforward: if you complete a hole in fewer strokes than par,
            you score under par; if it takes more strokes, you score over par.
            The goal is to finish the course with the fewest total strokes. The
            player with the lowest total score relative to par wins the game.

          <h3>RULES</h3>
          <p>
            The rules of golf are designed to ensure fairness and consistency
            throughout the game. Players must hit the ball from its current
            position without moving it, except in certain situations like taking
            a drop. If a ball goes out of bounds, players incur a penalty and
            must re-hit from the original spot. Special rules apply when the
            ball lands in hazards, such as bunkers or water, often requiring a
            penalty stroke and a specific method for proceeding. The main
            objective is to complete the course with the fewest number of
            strokes, with each hole having a par value that indicates the
            expected number of strokes for completion.
